## Cellular Automata 2D

Old (even if the repo. isn't that old), messy code for 2D Cellular Automata (also stochastic ones) in Haskell.

### Install
No cabal file.
Install SDL, SDL-gfx and random.

### TODO
    * Tests
    * infinite planes, moebius bands etc. as cellspace types
    * better ui
    * performance? e.g. only having tow arrays (less memory allocation)
    * cabal
